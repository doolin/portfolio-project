    %h3#who-needs Who needs a portfolio?
    %p
      We say "Who doesn't need a portfolio?"
    %p
      Your portfolio allows you to go into much greater
      detail about your accomplishments than is appropriate
      on resumes.
  %div
    %h3#who-needs Why do I need a portfolio site that’s different than my website?
    %p
      Having a portfolio is exactly like having a studio full of art versus showing
      your best stuff at a gallery. People who know you are going to be at your studio
      commissioning work. For people who don’t know you, being in a gallery is a way
      to increase the size of your audience.

    %h3#why-not-free Why isn't Portfolio Project free?'
    Three main reasons Portfolio Project isn't free:
    %ol
      %li
        Requiring even a modest payment increases authenticity.
        While it's easy to pose anonymously, payment information
        (which is never kept on Portfolio Project) ensures a real
        person was involved, not some spamming robot.
      %li
        Software costs money to create. Somebody has to
        pay for it. For members or users of free web applications,
        you - your attention - is the product for advertisers. When
        %em you
        are paying for the service,
        %em you
        are
        the customer.
      %li
        Charging even a nominal fee drastically reduces spam!
        Spammers can sign up for free web application accounts using web
        robots. Charging a token fee eliminates free riding
        parasites.
        Spam is extremely expensive burden to manage, and it
        exists because the spammers do not bear the costs of
        their behavior. Somebody is paying the electric bill,
        the hosting services charge, routing and name serving
        costs, they are simply parasites.
